Ember-Skeleton
==============

A starting project with file layout and Gruntfile for Ember development.

This package is setup to use:
* Coffeescript
* Stylus
* Jeet
* Ember.js
* Handlebars

Simply use `grunt watch` to monitor for changes and have the site compile to the `dist/final/public/` folder. Corresponding assets are compiled to their relevant positions inside the final folder.
